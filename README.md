This repository contains Java functionality for generating permutations and combinations. The generation functions constitute the Java conversion of the Scala functions available in the PermComb repository. 

Because Java (8) has no singly linked list container type, and the generation functions perform best with singly linked lists, a home made singly linked list container is made available as well.

The singly linked list (SList) is interesting in its own right. It offers most functionality that is usually available for container types, including iterability, so SList can be used in the enhanced for-statement. Many higher-order functions like filter, map, map2, foldLeft and foldRight are supported as well. The implementation is light-weight and very fast: comparable or faster than library versions of singly linked lists in other languages like for instance Scala.

Many of the available functions on SList have recursive implementations. This means that processing long lists can be problematic and cause stack overflow errors. The usual remedy against this is tail recursion. However, the Java compiler seems not to support tail recursion optimization, so using tail recursion is to no avail. Therefore I have not made the effort to convert recursion into tail recursion where this would have been possible. Java is just not mature in its functional aspects, by not offering a library singly linked list container and by not performing tail recursion optimization. SList can be use for very long lists, but then the size of the stack has to be enlarged explicitly.
